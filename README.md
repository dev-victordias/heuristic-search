# heuristic-search
The aim of the project was to find the lowest "weight" path for the 3 pendants, after that, for the master sword. 
The map has paths with different weights, such as grass (10) and water (180). 
The character (link) can start at any position on the map, as well as the pendants and also the master sword, for that, just update the csv file.
